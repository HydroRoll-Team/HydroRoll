# Troubleshooting

These are some common issues when starting.

## “cargo-nextest” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

On Macs, unsigned binaries cannot be run by default. To manually approve this
app, go to: [Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, under the General tab](x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security). You'll see "“cargo-nextest” was blocked from use because it is
not from an identified developer". Click the "Allow Anyway" button, and
`cargo-nextest` can be run on the next invocation.

## Cannot `pnpm install` because of oniguruma

Oniguruma does not provide a prebuilt binary for arm64 macOS. Further, macOS
does not provide a python2 environment by default anymore! You need to setup your
python environment, much like we would setup your node environment:

```shell
brew install pyenv
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
pyenv install 2.7.18
pyenv local 2.7.18
```

Now try `pnpm install` again.

## Cannot `pnpm install` because of canvas

Canvas does not provide a prebuilt binary for arm64. To manually compile,
you can use Homebrew to install the necessary packages:

```shell
brew install python pkg-config pixman cairo pango
```

Now try `pnpm install` again.
