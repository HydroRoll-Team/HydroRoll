# Testing in a Monorepo

Along with linting and building, testing is a crucial part of a production-ready monorepo. Whether you're using end-to-end tests or a unit test suite, integrating them with Turborepo will lead to enormous speed-ups.

## Working with test runners

Let's say we have a monorepo that looks like this:

```
├── apps
│   └── web
│       └── package.json
└── packages
    └── shared
        └── package.json
```

Both `apps/web` and `packages/shared` have their own test suite. Their `package.json` files look like this:

<Tabs items={["Jest", "Vitest"]} storageKey="selected-test-runner">
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  }
}
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Inside the root `turbo.json`, we recommend setting up a `test` task in your [pipeline](/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/running-tasks):

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "test": {}
  }
}
```

Now, you can run `turbo test` and have Turborepo test the entire repository.

Because of Turborepo's [caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching), this also means that only repositories that have changed files will be tested - resulting in a lot of time saved.

## Running tests in watch mode

When you run your test suite normally, it completes and outputs to `stdout`. This means you can [cache it](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching) with Turborepo.

But when you run your tests in watched mode, the process never exits. This makes a watch task more like a [development task](/repo/docs/handbook/dev).

Because of this difference, we recommend specifying **two separate Turborepo tasks**: one for running your tests, and one for running them in watch mode.

Here's an example:

<Tabs items={["Jest", "Vitest"]} storageKey="selected-test-runner">
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest"
  }
}
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "test": {},
    "test:watch": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "test:watch": "turbo run test:watch"
  }
}
```
