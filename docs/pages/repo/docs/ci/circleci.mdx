# Using Turborepo with CircleCI

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

For a given root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "1.2.5"
  }
}
```

And a `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
  }
}
```

Create a file called `.circleci/config.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```yaml
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
      node: circleci/node@5.0.2
    workflows:
      test:
        jobs:
          - test
    jobs:
      test:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/node:lts
        steps:
          - checkout
          - node/install-packages
          - run:
            command: npm run build
          - run:
            command: npm run test
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```yaml
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
      node: circleci/node@5.0.2
    workflows:
      test:
        jobs:
          - test
    jobs:
      test:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/node:lts
        steps:
          - checkout
          - node/install-packages:
            pkg-manager: yarn
          - run:
            command: yarn build
          - run:
            command: yarn test
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```yaml
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
      node: circleci/node@5.0.2
    workflows:
      test:
        jobs:
          - test
    jobs:
      test:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/node:lts
        steps:
          - checkout
          - node/install-packages:
          - run:
            command: npm i -g pnpm
          - run:
            command: pnpm build
          - run:
            command: pnpm test
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with CircleCI, add the following environment variables to your CircleCI project
to make them available to your `turbo` commands.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your CircleCI project settings and click on the **Environment Variables** tab. Create a new secret called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![CircleCI Create Environment Variables](/images/docs/circleci-create-environment-variables.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL _without_ the `vercel.com/`. Your Team URL can be found inside your team's general project settings from the dashboard.

   If you're using a Hobby Plan, you can use your username. Your username can be found in your [Vercel Personal Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account)

4. CircleCI automatically loads environment variables stored in project settings into the CI environment. No modifications are necessary for the CI file.
