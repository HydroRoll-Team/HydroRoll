# Add Turborepo to your existing project

Turborepo can be used in **any project** to speed up the execution of scripts in your `package.json`.

After you install `turbo`, you'll be able to run all your `package.json` tasks from `turbo` instead of your package manager.

By configuring your `turbo.json` correctly, you'll notice how [caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching) helps your tasks run a lot faster.

## Quickstart

0. **If you don't have one already, create a new application:**

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Vite']} storageKey="selected-framework">
  <Tab>
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

1. **Install `turbo` globally:**

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install turbo --global
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn global add turbo
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add turbo --global
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For more details about installation, see [Installing Turborepo](../installing)

2. **Add a `turbo.json` file at the base of your new repository:**

For more information on configuring your `turbo.json`, see the [Configuration Options](/repo/docs/reference/configuration) documentation.

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Vite']} storageKey="selected-framework">
  <Tab>
```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```

Some Vite starters ship with a `package.json` that looks like this:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && vite build"
  }
}
```

We recommend splitting these into a `lint` and `build` script.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "tsc"
  }
}
```

This means that Turbo can schedule them separately.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

3. **Edit `.gitignore`**

Add `.turbo` to your `.gitignore` file. The CLI uses these folders for logs and certain task outputs.

```diff
+ .turbo
```

4. **Try running `build` and `lint` with `turbo`:**

```bash
turbo build lint
```

This runs `build` and `lint` at the same time.

5. **Without making any changes to the code, try running `build` and `lint` again:**

```bash
turbo build lint
```

You should see terminal output like this:

```
 Tasks:    2 successful, 2 total
Cached:    2 cached, 2 total
  Time:    185ms >>> FULL TURBO
```

Congratulations - **you just completed a build and lint in under 200ms**.

To learn how this is possible, check out our [core concepts docs](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching).

6. **Try running `dev` with `turbo`:**

```bash
turbo dev
```

You'll notice that your `dev` script starts up. You can use `turbo` to run any script in your `package.json`.
