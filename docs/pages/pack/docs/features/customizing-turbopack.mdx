# Customizing Turbopack

Turbopack can be customized to transform different files and change how modules are resolved. It supports a subset of webpack's loader API and offers similar configuration aliasing module resolution.

## webpack loaders for Next.js

<Callout type="info">
  Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality, just as they aren't required for Next.js. Turbopack has built-in support for css and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're just using `@babel/preset-env`.
</Callout>

If you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:

- Only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. This is enough for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our support for this API in the future.
- Only loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.
- Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.

As of Next 13.2, configuring webpack loaders is possible for Next.js apps through an experimental option in `next.config.js`. `turbo.loaders` can be set as a mapping of file extensions to a list of package names or `{loader, options}` pairs:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      loaders: {
        // Option format
        '.md': [
          {
            loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
            options: {
              format: 'md',
            },
          },
        ],
        // Option-less format
        '.mdx': ['@mdx-js/loader'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

If you need to pass something like the result of importing an external package as a loader option, it's possible to wrap the webpack loader with your own, specifying options there. **This is an interim solution and should not be necessary in the future.** This loader wraps `@mdx-js/loader` and configures the `rehypePrism` rehype plugin:

```js filename="my-mdx-loader.js"
const mdxLoader = require('@mdx-js/loader');
const rehypePrism = require('@mapbox/rehype-prism');

module.exports = function (code) {
	const prevGetOptions = this.getOptions.bind(this);
	this.getOptions = function getOptions(...args) {
		return {
			...prevGetOptions(...args),
			rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism]
		}
	}

	mdxLoader.call(this, code);
}
```

Then, configure Next.js to load the wrapper loader:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      loaders: {
        '.mdx': ['./my-mdx-loader'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Supported loaders

The following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:

- [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)
- [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/loader)
- [`@svgr/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack)
- [`svg-inline-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-inline-loader)
- [`yaml-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-loader)
- [`string-replace-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-replace-loader)
- [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)

## Resolve aliases

Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    turbo: {
      resolveAlias: {
        underscore: 'lodash',
        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.

Turbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.
