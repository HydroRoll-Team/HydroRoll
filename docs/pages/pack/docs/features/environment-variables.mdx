# Environment variables

## `.env` files

Turbopack will parse and inject `.env` files out of the box.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="my-site"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://"
```

This includes all the variations these files come in:

```
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.production.local
```

### Live reloading

Not only that, but Turbopack will live reload when these values change. Restarting your dev server just to inject a new environment variable can be extremely annoying - Turbopack does it for you.

## `process.env`

Environment variables will be injected into `process.env`. For instance, `DATABASE_URL` will be on `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.

This follows the tradition of Node.js, webpack 5 and Next.js 12, which each use `process.env` for variable injection.
