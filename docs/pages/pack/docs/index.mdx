# Getting Started with Turbopack

Turbopack is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust by the creators of webpack and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The secret to Turbopack's performance is twofold: highly optimized machine code and a low-level incremental computation engine that enables caching down to the level of individual functions. Once Turbopack performs a task it never does it again.

Our team has taken the lessons from 10 years of webpack, combined with the innovations in incremental computation from [Turborepo](/repo) and Google's Bazel, and created an architecture ready to support the coming decades of computing.

    Turbopack is currently in <strong>alpha</strong>. It is not yet ready for production use. We appreciate your support and feedback as we work to make it ready for everyone.

## Quickstart

As of today, Turbopack can be used in Next.js v13. In the future we will be releasing a standalone CLI, plugin API, and support for other frameworks such as Svelte and Vue. For now, please follow these instructions to get started:

1. Create a Next.js v13 project with Turbopack:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-turbopack
```

2. Start the Next.js development server (with Turbopack):

  <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn dev
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm dev
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

The Next.js v13 development server is now powered by Turbopack! Startup and updates should both be near-instant. The larger the application, the larger the improvement will be.
